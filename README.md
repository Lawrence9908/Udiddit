# Udiddit - Social News Aggregator Project

Hello everyone! I am excited to introduce you to the Udiddit project, a social news aggregator, content rating, and discussions website. As part of this project, my task is to assess the current data model stored in Postgres, identify any flaws, and then improve the system by creating a more robust schema and adding web analytics.

## Project Introduction and Instructions

### Part I: Investigate the existing schema

To start off, I delve into the current data model and thoroughly investigate it for any issues. The detailed tasks and instructions can be found in the Google Docs document provided to me. I have made a copy of the document to document my findings and steps.

### Part II: Create the DDL for your new schema

Once I have a clear understanding of the current data model's flaws, the next step i design and create a new schema for the Udiddit system. This new schema will address the identified issues and aim to make the data model more robust.

### Part III: Migrate the provided data

After finalizing the new schema, I proceed to migrate the existing data from the provided SQL Workspace (bad_db.sql) into the new schema. This will ensure that the system continues to function seamlessly with the updated data model.

## Project Workspace

As part of the project resources, there is a SQL Workspace containing a dump of all the current data that Udiddit has been gathering. This workspace allows me to test my queries against real-life data, which is extremely helpful for validating the changes I make to the data model.

## Supporting Materials

The project also includes some supporting materials to aid me in completing the tasks:

1. [Google Docs Template](link-to-google-docs-template) - This document contains detailed instructions and tasks for the project. I have already created a copy of this document to record my progress and findings.
2. [bad_db.sql](link-to-bad-db-sql) - This file contains the SQL dump of the current data gathered by Udiddit. I can use this data to test my queries in the SQL Workspace or any other environment as required.

## Project Rubric

Before I submit my final project, I make sure to review the project rubric thoroughly. This way, I can ensure that my work aligns with the requirements outlined in the rubric, making the project a fully functional and successful one.

If I have any questions or need clarifications during the project, I can always reach out to the project supervisor or mentor for guidance.

I am eager to make a positive impact on Udiddit by resolving data model issues and enhancing its features.
